This application demonstrates the implementation of a binary search tree as a class.

Simply enter "nmake BinarySearchTree" to run the test program on the binary search tree and 
count the amount of each of the words in both of the .txt files provided.
You can also enter "nmake test" and "nmake count" to run each program individually.

After executing the application, you can enter "nmake clean" to delete .obj,
.exe and .lib files made during compilation.

The expected output from entering this is to show:
> Which of the required methods have been implemented into the binary search tree correctly.
> The amount of each/different word(s) (excluding punctuation) in the .txt files.
